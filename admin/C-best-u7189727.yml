# Here are my best codes (in Java style) as a method of checking the number of players.
# This may extend the capability of number of plays in game although
# only 2 players are mentioned in these tasks' requirements.
#
# With the given string of the total playerState, the player character A-D are tracked and made to an indexArray.
# If the character of player exist in the string, the play will be in the game.
# Except the first playString, an "-" is inserted before each playerState.
# After that, the total playerState string is split for each player and the number of player can be get.
# The number of players are counted.
#
#
# The codes:( in Java style )

#  public static int getNUmberOfPlayer(String playerState) {
#    // get number of players -> extend for 4 players
#    int numberOfPlayer = 0;
#    int indexA = playerState.indexOf("A");
#    int indexB = playerState.indexOf("B");
#    int indexC = playerState.indexOf("C");
#    int indexD = playerState.indexOf("D");
#    int[] player = {indexA, indexB, indexC, indexD};
#    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(playerState);
#    int numberOfOperations = 0;
#  for (int v : player) {
#    if (v != -1 && v != 0) {
#    sb.insert(v + numberOfOperations, "-");
#    numberOfOperations++;
#    }
#  }
#    String newString = sb.toString();
#
#    String[] string1Array = newString.split("-");
#    //key result
#    int wellFormedPlayer = 0;
#  for (String playerString : string1Array) {
#    numberOfPlayer++;
#  }
#    return numberOfPlayer;
