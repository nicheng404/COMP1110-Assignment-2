Reviewing code written by: <Ke Ning> <u7175553>

Component: <Floor.java>

### Comments 

Ke Ning did a good job in putting straight forward comments for each part of the method. 
Some methods without comments are with simple namings ,such as getFloorString, which need not require a comment or documentation.
 I really like the way Ke Ning use switch to check all the cases for validity of floor.Switch is a clear presentation.
 Also, for those methods that are long, Ke Ning would have documentations for those methods which also make the  codes easy to read and understand it's function.
 Ke Ning's codes would be better by maybe considering the case of the string is being null.
